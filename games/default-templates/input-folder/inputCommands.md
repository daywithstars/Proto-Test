### Hardware Limitation 

Some hardware limitation like on "cheap" keyboards, can only handler with an range of keys in the 
same circuit. If you try to create an game with more than the number of simultaneously key pressed on the same keyboard circuit it will fail to grab those key press into the Proto-Test. 

Trying avoid that, you can use less key hold and use more key pressed or released.
