# Level template structure

All the levels are generated by Tiled. But some additional information are required in order to some subsystem works properly, those are described below:

## Tileset


- The tileset image need to be loaded by the Proto-Test using the *img-list.json*. 
- When adding a tileset to Tiled you need to mark the option: **Embed in map**.
- *margin* and *spacing* need to be zero, other values will not works as spectated.
  - later, it will works.
